    <string name="app_description">Different people have different styles of learning. The VAK model holds that people absorb information in a visual, an auditory, and a kinesthetic way.\n\nYour educator should know what kind of learner you are to adapt his teaching to your individual needs.\n\nThis app will give you questions to determine your learning style and allows you to send this information to your educator.</string>

    <string name="visual_style">Visual learners prefer to absorb information with their eyes. That means they find it easier to learn by reading (visual-linguistic learner) or looking at charts, images, and other visual items (visual-spatial learner).</string>
    <string name="auditory_style">Auditory learners prefer to absorb information with their ears. That means they find it easier to learn by listening to someone speak or lecture.</string>
    <string name="kinesthetic_style">Kinesthetic learners prefer to absorb information by movement and touching. That means that they have to do something to learn and keep involved in learning processes by being physically engaged.</string>


    <string name="questionaire_instructions">Please answer the following questions to determine your learning type:</string>

    <string name="question_visual_li">I am good at remembering written instructions.</string>
